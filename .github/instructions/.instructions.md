# Project Overview

This project is a repository for my MacOS machine configuration. It aims to provide a consistent and reproducible setup across different machines.

## Goals

- Provide a consistent development environment across different machines
- Automate the setup process as much as possible
- Make it easy to reproduce the setup on a new machine
- Allow for easy per-machine customization of the setup

## Directory Structure

- `bootstrap.sh`: A script to bootstrap the setup process. This script will install the necessary dependencies and set up the initial configuration.
- `scripts/`: A directory containing utility scripts for common tasks.
- `ansible/`: A directory containing Ansible playbooks and roles for configuration management.
- `justfile`: A file containing definitions for common tasks using the Just command runner.

## Tools for Configuration Management

- homebrew: Package manager
- git: Version control system
- zsh: Shell
- just: Command runner
- node.js + typescript + zx: Scripting and programming
- ansible: Automation tool

## Standards

- Use long-form flags in commands when possible
- Use env shebangs in scripts. For example, in sh scripts, prefer using `#!/usr/bin/env sh` as the shebang.

## Guidelines

- All scripts and commands must be idempotent, meaning they can be run multiple times without changing the result beyond the initial application.
- Never hardcode secrets or sensitive information. Use environment variables, dotenv files, or secret management tools.
- Put tool specific config into its own top level directory. For example, create a `git/` directory for Git-related configurations or a `zsh/` directory for Zsh-related configurations.
- Use sh and zsh scripts for simple scripting tasks.
- Use node.js + typescript + zx for more complex scripting tasks. Use the latest LTS version (v22.18.x as of now which supports type stripping by default).
- Use Ansible for configuration management and automation tasks when the complexity warrants it.
- Use just for running commands and tasks.
- Programming languages should use version management tools where applicable. For example, use `pyenv` for Python, `fnm` for Node.js, and `rbenv` for Ruby. Some languages, like Go, do not need version management.
- All steps for applying the configuration should be documented and automated where possible.
